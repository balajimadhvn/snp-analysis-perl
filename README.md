# SNP Analysis Tool in Perl

## Description

This Perl script is designed for analyzing Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data from Variant Call Format (VCF) files. It reads SNP data, calculates genotype frequencies across samples, and provides basic statistical analysis.

## Features

- Read VCF Files:** Parses SNP data from VCF files.
- **Calculate Genotype Frequencies:** Computes genotype frequencies for each SNP across samples.
- **Simple and Extendable:** Easily extendable for additional SNP analyses and visualizations.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Perl 5.x or higher installed on your system.
- Getopt::Long module (usually included in Perl distributions).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

### Running the Script

To run the SNP analysis tool, execute the Perl script `snp_analysis.pl` with the following command-line options:

```bash
./snp_analysis.pl -v /path/to/your/snp_data.vcf
```

### Command-line Options

- `-v, --vcf`: Path to the VCF file containing SNP data (required).
- `-h, --help`: Display usage instructions.

### Example

To analyze SNP data in the file `example_data.vcf`, run:

```bash
./snp_analysis.pl -v example_data.vcf
```

### Output

The script calculates genotype frequencies and prints results to the standard output.

```
Genotype 0/0: 0.55
Genotype 0/1: 0.35
Genotype 1/1: 0.10
```
